    // Policies and Terms (Full Text)
    privacy_text: `# Giveaway+ Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 24.01.2026

As Giveaway+ ("Bot"), we value your privacy and data security. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and stored when using our bot.

## 1. Collected Data
To provide our services, we collect and store the following information:

* **User IDs:** To determine giveaway winners, verify participants, check blacklist status, and manage premium memberships.
* **Guild IDs:** To save server-specific settings (language, log channels, etc.) and premium status.
* **Channel IDs:** To track where giveaway messages are sent.
* **Giveaway Data:** Giveaway details such as prize names, durations, winners, and participant counts (for \`history\` command).
* **Templates:** Custom giveaway templates created by users or servers.

## 2. Purpose of Data Use
Collected data is used solely for the following purposes:

* Starting, managing, and concluding giveaways.
* Preventing malicious users via the "Blacklist" system.
* Listing past giveaways with the \`/history\` command.
* Remembering server-specific language (\`/language\`) settings.
* Activating and tracking Premium features.

## 3. Data Sharing
Collected data is **strictly** NOT shared or sold to third-party companies, advertisers, or other organizations. Data is used solely for the functionality of the bot.

## 4. Data Retention Period
* **Active Giveaways:** Data is processed in real-time during the giveaway period.
* **Past Data:** Giveaway history (\`history\`) and server settings are stored as long as the bot is in the server or until the user requests deletion.

## 5. User Rights and Data Deletion
Users have the right to request the deletion of their data. If you wish to have your data completely removed from our system, please contact us via our Support Server.

## 6. Changes
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When significant changes are made, notifications will be made via the bot's support server or announcement channels.

    tos_text: `# Giveaway+ Terms of Service (ToS)

Last Updated: 24.01.2026

Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Giveaway+ ("Bot") service. By adding the bot to your server or using its commands, you agree to these terms.

## 1. General Use
Giveaway+ is a tool designed to manage giveaway events on Discord servers. Users agree to use the bot only for its intended purpose.

* Users must comply with Discord's own [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
* Exploiting any vulnerability, bug, or security flaw of the bot is prohibited.

## 2. Restrictions and Bans (Blacklist)
In the following cases, bot management reserves the right to add the user or server to the **"Blacklist"**, blocking bot usage temporarily or permanently:

* Spamming the bot or intentionally stressing API limits.
* Organizing fake giveaways to scam or mislead other users.
* Attempting to copy the bot's source code or perform reverse engineering.

## 3. Premium Services and Refund Policy
Giveaway+ may offer "Premium" membership for access to certain features.

* **Digital Content:** Premium membership is a digital service. Once the purchase is completed, **no refunds** are made unless there is a technical defect originating from the service.
* **Transfer:** Premium memberships are not transferable to another account (except at management's initiative).
* **Pricing:** Management reserves the right to change premium prices and features with prior notice.

## 4. Disclaimer
Giveaway+ is just a tool.

* **Prize Delivery:** Bot management is **not responsible** for the delivery of prizes promised by server owners. The reliability of giveaways is entirely the responsibility of the organizing server.
* **Data Loss:** Bot management cannot be held responsible for data loss due to potential technical failures, Discord API outages, or database issues.
* **Interruptions:** 100% uptime is not guaranteed; interruptions may occur during maintenance work.

## 5. Changes to Terms
The bot developer reserves the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Users agree to the updated terms by continuing to use the bot.
